# Blazor Sample Applications for Choreo

This sample repository contains three kinds of Blazor sample applications, demonstrating different use cases and database integrations.

## Samples Included

*   **BlazorHelloWorld**: A bare-minimum "Hello, World!" sample application to get started with Blazor on Choreo.
*   **BlazorWebAppMovies**: A movie listing application that connects to a managed PostgreSQL database.
*   **BlazorMongoDB**: A student record management application that uses a MongoDB database.

## Origin

The samples in this repository are derived from the official Blazor examples repository.

> **Important Note**
>
> By default, the official Blazor samples use a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database. These examples have been migrated to use **PostgreSQL** to demonstrate compatibility with Choreo's managed database offerings.
